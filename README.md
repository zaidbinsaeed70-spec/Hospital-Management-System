# Hospital-Management-System
This Project presents the design and implementation of a Hospital Management System (HMS) developed to handle patient registration, appointment scheduling, and emergency triage. The system is designed to solve the "Complex Engineering Problem" of resource allocation and data retrieval efficiency in a high-pressure healthcare environment.
